% Basic Inputs : 
%   input_map : a logical array where the freespace cells are false or 0 and
%   the obstacles are true or 1
%   start_coords and dest_coords : Coordinates of the start and end cell
%   respectively, the first entry is the row and the second the column.
% Basic Output :
%    route : An array containing the linear indices of the cells along the
%    shortest route from start to dest or an empty array if there is no
%    route. This is a single dimensional vector
%    Step: Remember to also return the total number of nodes
%    expanded during your search. Do not count the goal node as an expanded node.
